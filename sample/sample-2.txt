Hello, dear $name!!!
My love is like an ocean 
It goes down so deep 
My love is like a rose 
Whose beauty you want to keep. 
My love is like a river 
That will never end 
My love is like a dove 
With a beautiful message to send. 
My love is like a song 
That goes on and on forever 
My love is like a prisoner 
Its to you that I surrender.

I decided to start my letter with such a nice poem. However, the worlds there are very simple, but very beautiful. I always have them on my mind and I am sure that one day I will tell them to my man. I miss love and that is why I am here. I have a very tender and romantic heart which wants to love and to be loved and I am ready to give my heart with all its warmth to my future man. Who knows may be you could become my special man. Let us try!!!! I am very open to our communication and I hope everything will be alright between us. I hope to hear from you soon. I do want to tell you about myself and I am sure that we would build an interesting communication in the future.
Take care.
With all my warmth, Yulia.
